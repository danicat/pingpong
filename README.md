# Ping Pong

This is the supporting material for my talk "Production Ready Hello World".

## Problem Statement

You are in charge of developing an application called "pingpong". This application is a web server that listens to requests and if it receives a GET request on the "/ping" path it should respond the message "pong". 

The code should be production ready: include all the things that you consider important in production code, but you are only allowed to use packages from the standard library.

## Requirements

- Use package http
- Use package httptest
- Use package json
