# Ping Pong

This is the supporting material for my talk "Production Ready Hello World".

## Problem Statement

You are in charge of writting an application called "pingpong". The purpose of this application is to run as a web server that listens for requests and if it receives a GET request on the "/ping" path it should respond the message "pong".

The code should be production ready. Include all the things that you consider important in production code, but you are only allowed to use packages from the standard library.

## Requirements

- Use package http
- Use package httptest
- Use package json
